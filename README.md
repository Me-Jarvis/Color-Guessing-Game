## Introduction:
This is a mini project to learn structure forming using DOM methods in HTML, CSS and JS, that I learnt during my "Web Developer Bootcamp".

## Landing Page:
As we open the project we land on the page *as shown above*.
The window is classified into two divisions:<br/> 
1. [Navigation Bar](#Navigation-Bar)
2. [Playing Palette](#Playing-Palette).


### Navigation Bar:
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/gauravbisht005/Color-Guessing-Game/blob/master/assets/Navigation Bar.JPG">
</div>

In the Navigation Bar, we can see the **Title** of the game, a **RGB Value** enclosed within paranthesis, **New Colors** tab, and the **Mode of difficulty**.
<dl>
  <dt>Title -</dt>
  <dd>The Great RGB Color Game</dd>
  <dt>RGB Value -</dt>
  <dd>It is a color scheme that represents the intensities of Red, Green and Blue color in forming a color. Each intensity value caries within a range of 0 to 255.</dd>
  <dt>New Colors -</dt>
  <dd>This tab refreshes the color tiles in the Playing Palette.</dd>
  <dt>Mode of Difficulty -</dt>
  <dd>This section represents 2 buttons: Easy and Hard, denoting the difficulty level by increasing or decreasing the number of tiles in the Playing Palette.</dd>
</dl>


### Playing Palette:
In the Playing Palette, we observe a grid of tiles of different colors (encoded using RGB Color Scheme) and of varying numbers depending upon the mode of difficulty selected.

</div>


## Objective of the game:
After getting familiar with the window of the game. It then comes to how to play? As we can see in the paranthesis, a RGB value is given which refreshes with every turn or new game. The objective of the game is to figure out the colored tiles which has the same RGB value as given in the paranthesis.

</div>
The game keeps on going untill the correct tile is selected.


## How does the game end?
The game finishes after correctly guessing the RGB Valued Tile!!
